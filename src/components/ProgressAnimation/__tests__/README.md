# Animation Test Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive test suite for the animation system in the Todo App. The animation system consists of two main components:

## Components Under Test

### 1. AnimationHandler (Service)
- **Location**: `src/services/AnimationHandler.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages animation queuing and dispatching custom events
- **Key Features**:
  - Queue-based animation system
  - Sequential animation playback
  - Custom event dispatching
  - Completion callbacks
  - Error handling

### 2. ProgressAnimationContainer (React Component)
- **Location**: `src/components/ProgressAnimation/ProgressAnimationContainer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Renders animated balls in a circular pattern
- **Key Features**:
  - Event-driven animation triggers
  - Ball positioning algorithm (concentric circles)
  - React Spring animations
  - LocalStorage persistence
  - Date-based state management

## Test Files

### 1. AnimationHandler.test.ts
Tests for the core animation service including:
- ✅ Animation queueing and parameter validation
- ✅ Sequential playback timing
- ✅ Event dispatching
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Callback management
- ✅ Singleton pattern verification

### 2. ProgressAnimationContainer.test.tsx
Tests for the React component including:
- ✅ Component rendering and styling
- ✅ Event listener setup/cleanup
- ✅ LocalStorage integration
- ✅ Error handling for malformed data
- ✅ Accessibility features
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ⚠️  Ball positioning (mock limitations)
- ⚠️  Animation state transitions (timing issues)

### 3. AnimatedBall.test.tsx
Unit tests for individual ball behavior:
- ✅ Ball lifecycle states
- ✅ Position calculations
- ✅ Color application
- ✅ Animation timing
- ✅ Performance considerations

### 4. AnimationIntegration.test.tsx
End-to-end integration tests:
- ✅ Complete animation workflow
- ✅ Error recovery and graceful degradation
- ✅ Memory management
- ✅ Event-driven communication
- ✅ State persistence

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Core animation functionality
- ✅ Ball positioning algorithms
- ✅ Event handling and communication
- ✅ State management and persistence
- ✅ Error scenarios and edge cases

### Performance Testing
- ✅ Rapid animation requests
- ✅ Large ball counts
- ✅ Memory leak prevention
- ✅ Component lifecycle management

### Accessibility Testing
- ✅ Reduced motion preferences
- ✅ High contrast mode support
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility

### Integration Testing
- ✅ AnimationHandler ↔ ProgressAnimationContainer communication
- ✅ LocalStorage persistence across sessions
- ✅ Date change handling
- ✅ Error boundary behavior

## Known Test Limitations

### 1. React Spring Mocking
The test suite uses mocked versions of React Spring animations, which means:
- ❌ Actual animation timing cannot be fully tested
- ❌ Visual animation effects are not verified
- ✅ Component behavior and state changes are tested

### 2. LocalStorage Testing
- ✅ Basic read/write operations tested
- ✅ Error scenarios covered
- ❌ Cross-tab synchronization not tested
- ❌ Storage quota limits partially tested

### 3. Event System Testing
- ✅ Custom event dispatching verified
- ✅ Event listener cleanup tested
- ❌ Browser-specific event behavior not covered

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all animation tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="Animation"

# Run specific test suites
npm test AnimationHandler.test.ts
npm test ProgressAnimationContainer.test.tsx
npm test AnimationIntegration.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="Animation" --coverage
```

## Test Patterns Used

### 1. Mocking Strategy
- **Services**: Partial mocking preserving core logic
- **DOM APIs**: Complete mocking for localStorage, events
- **React Components**: Shallow mocking for dependencies

### 2. Error Testing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensures app continues working with failures
- **Input Validation**: Tests malformed data handling
- **Resource Limits**: Tests quota exceeded scenarios

### 3. Performance Testing
- **Memory Leaks**: Repeated mount/unmount cycles
- **Resource Cleanup**: Event listener removal verification
- **Throttling**: Rapid successive operation handling

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing naming patterns: `describe` → `it` structure
2. Use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
3. Mock external dependencies appropriately
4. Include both positive and negative test cases

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
2. Update mocks when component APIs change
3. Preserve error handling test coverage
4. Document any breaking changes

### Common Issues
1. **Timing**: Use `waitFor` for async operations
2. **Cleanup**: Always clean up mocks in `afterEach`
3. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
4. **Mocking**: Ensure mocks match real API behavior

## Future Improvements
